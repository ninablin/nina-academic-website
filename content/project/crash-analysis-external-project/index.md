title: NYC Crash Event Analysis
#summary: An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.
summary: One of my best friends moved to New York in the summer of 2019. Since then, I've always wanted to see how bad the traffic is in New York compared to the Bay Area. So I decided to create this application to visualize the distribution of crash events in New York City and perhaps work as a reference for my friend whenever he wants to walk around the city. Moreover, I felt this was a nice opportunity to see how much various information can be extracted from this dataset.
