title: NYC Crash Event Analysis
#summary: An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.
summary: One of my best friends moved to New York in the summer of 2019 because he got accepted to NYU. Ever since then, I've always wanted to see how bad the traffic is in New York after hearing some bad news about it. So I decided to create this application to visualize the distribution of crash events in New York City and perhaps work as a reference for my friend when he decided where to travel inside the city. Moreover, I felt this was a nice opportunity to see how much various information can be extracted from this dataset.
